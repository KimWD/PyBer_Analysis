# PyBer_Ride_Sharing_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis: 
A summary DataFrame was completed with the ride-sharing data gathered from PyBer by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, multiple-line graphs that show the total weekly fares for each city type were created. Will discuss how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
